# dotfiles

An elegant way to manage dotfiles, shell scripts, auto-completion files, configurations for terminal players.

**Currently, it is only a personal workplace rather than a framework. So you should FORK the REPO first before using it.**

## Features

- Manage collections of dotfiles. Create soft-link via [dotbot][]. See [the configuration][install.conf.yaml].
- Manage shell scripts/completions/aliases/plugins by modules via [bash-it][].
  - Most features are implemented in separate plugins, which could be disabled by yourself.
  - All my plugins are put in [`bash_it/plugins/available/`](./bash_it/plugins/available/). `a list-plugins -a` to print all plugin names.
  - Some plugins powered by bash-it. `bash-it show plugins` to print all bash-it plugins.
- Compatible with [bash-completion][] (for bash 3.x) and [bash-completion2][bash-completion] (for bash 4.x). See the [configuration](https://github.com/adoyle-h/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_it/completions.bash)
- Responsive and pretty PS1, and personalized theme `𝕬`. Refer to [Preview](#preview).
- Collections of shell commands, which locates in [`bin/`](./bin/). Refer to [Binary executables](#binary-executables).
- Manage sub-commands, which locates in [`bin/sub/`](./bin/sub/). The sub-commands framework is modified from [sub][].
  - Default `SUB_NAME=a`, type `a help` for getting help. You can modify the enterpoint (`SUB_NAME`) in Plugin: [sub.plugin.bash](./bash_it/plugins/available/sub.plugin.bash)
  - Refer to [Sub-commands](#sub-commands) for more.
- My best practices for shell (bash).
- My best practices for [neovim][]. See [the configuration](https://github.com/adoyle-h/neovim-config).
- My best practices for [tmux][]. See [the configuration](https://github.com/adoyle-h/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/tmux.conf).
- My best practices for git. See [the configuration](https://github.com/adoyle-h/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/gitconfig).
- My cheat sheets based on [chrisallenlane/cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat).
- Many third integrations
  - [z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua).
  - [fzf][]. See [the configuration](https://github.com/adoyle-h/dotfiles/blob/master/bash-custom/fzf.plugin.bash).
  - [taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook).

## Version

No version yet

## Core Dependencies

- [git][]: **It is required**. Make sure it available before installation.
  - [git-prompt][]: If omitted, PS1 will not show git prompt.
- [dotbot][]: To create symbolic links and manage them by [`install.conf.yaml`][install.conf.yaml]. No need to install it manually. It is a part of this repo.
- [bash-it][]: To manage all shell scripts in modules: aliases, plugins, completions and shell appearance theme. No need to install it manually. It is a part of this repo.

## Installation

```sh
# Set your Dotfile directory path
DOTFILE_DIR=~/dotfiles
echo "DOTFILE_DIR=$DOTFILE_DIR" > ~/.dotfilerc

# Clone this repo
git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/adoyle-h/dotfiles.git $DOTFILE_DIR
cd $DOTFILE_DIR
# Clone submodules and initialize them
git submodule update --init --depth 1 --recursive

# Install bash_it framework which is required
./pkgs/bash-it/install.sh --no-modify-config

# You may check the content of `install.conf.yaml` file,
# Then make soft-links for dotfiles
./install
# Checkout the output

# Reset bash-it
. ${DOTFILE_DIR}/bootstraps/reset-bash
```

The `install` script will generated a file `$HOME/.dotfilerc`. **Do not modify or remove it.**

And then read the [Configuration - Modifications by yourself](#modifications-by-yourself) section.

### Bootstrap

**IT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT USE!**

Run `./bootstrap` to initialize in a new environment.

**Do not call the script under sudo.**

## Configuration

### Modifications by yourself

These parts of below files you should modify:

./configs/gitconfig:

```
[user]
    name = <your-username>
    email = <your-email>
```

### UI

`$TERM` should be `xterm-256color` or `screen-256color` for best appearance.

- Font: [DejaVuSansMonoForPowerline Nerd Font Book][font]
- Color Scheme: [Deep][color scheme]. [Installation Instructions][color scheme - installation]

### Dotfiles

Edit the [`install.conf.yaml`][install.conf.yaml] file.

## Usage

### Binary executables

All your own binary executables should be put in [`bin`](./bin/) folder, which has been added to `$PATH`.

### Sub-commands

These executables could also be put in [`bin/sub/`]('./bin/sub/') which has been added to `$PATH`,
and it could be referred as sub-command. Example:

- `a help`
- `a bins` to show all commands in `./bin/`
- `a comments` to show all commands in `./bin/sub/`
- `a 256color`
- `a debug open` and `a debug close` to open/close debug mode

All sub-commands are auto-completed. Type `a <Tab>` to see all sub-commands.

### Enable bash-it plugins/aliases/completion

This framework is based on [bash-it][]. All features supported.
Type `bash-it` for help.

Two sub-commands provided:

- `a bash-it-status` to show all aliases/plugins/completions you enabled.
- `a bash-it-status -e` to save all aliases/plugins/completions you enabled.

### Enable custom plugins

Because bash-it not support to private plugins. I write many custom plugins in [bash_it/plugins/](./bash_it/plugins/).
And provide some sub-commands to enable/disable them.

- `a enable-plugin plugin-name1 plugin-name2` to enable plugin in `bash-custom/available/`
- `a disable-plugin plugin-name1 plugin-name2` to disable plugin in `bash-custom/enabled/`
- `a list-plugins` to show all enabled plugins in `bash-custom/enabled/`
- `a list-plugins -a` to show all plugins in `bash-custom/available/`

```

## Bash initialization process

It will execute scripts in order:

1. bash/bashrc
    - Read "$HOME"/.dotfilerc to detect the path of Dotfiles project directory
2. $HOME/.bash_it.bash => bash_it/enable
3. bash_it framework
    - bash_it/aliases.bash
    - bash_it/plugins.bash
    - bash_it/completions.bash
    - [custom] bash_it/aliases.bash
    - [custom] bash_it/plugins.bash
    - [custom] bash_it/completions.bash
    - bash-custom/theme/**/*.bash
4. bash_it/custom/*.bash
5. bash_it/plugins/enabled/*.bash


## Advanced Usage

### Use ~/.fast_bashrc for rescue

If `.bashrc` has any critical issue, you could create a `~/.fast_bashrc` file to replace `~/.bashrc`. Restart your shell to reload `.fast_bashrc`.

### Use ~/.bashrc.debug for debug

`touch ~/.bashrc.debug` and restart shell. You will see the debug logs from stdout.

Remove `~/.bashrc.debug` and restart shell will turn off debug logs.

### Customize your Bash by plugin

You can customize Bash by making a plugin.
All custom plugins must be put in [`bash-custom/available/`](./bash-custom/available) and filename must be suffixed with `.plugin.bash`.

Below content as template,

```sh
cite about-plugin
about-plugin 'Plugin description'

# put your shellscript codes here
```

Then you can invoke `a enable-plugin <plugin-name>` to enable the plugin.

### Enable plugin for specific system

- `a enable-plugin macos`
- `a enable-plugin debian`

### Other modifications

Sometimes, you could modify the files in `bash_it/` for prior execution.

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN [`bash/`](./bash/) folder.

### Write a sub-command

These executables could also be put in [`bin/sub/`]('./bin/sub/') which is included in `$PATH`,
and it could be referred as sub-command.

#### sub-command document

Your could write Usage/Summary/Help for sub-command.
Put below text to your `bin/sub/<sub-command>`,

```sh
# Usage: a who
# Summary: Check who's logged in
# Help: This will print out when you run `a help who`.
```

Enter `a` to get all usages.
And `a help <sub-command>` for getting "Summary" and "Help" of the sub-command.

Refer to [Self-documenting subcommands](https://github.com/basecamp/sub#self-documenting-subcommands) for more details.

#### sub-command completion

Sub-command completion **must be** implemented with below text in your `bin/sub/<sub-command>` file.

```sh
# Provide sub completions
if [ "$1" = "--complete" ]; then
  ls
fi
```

Refer to https://github.com/basecamp/sub#autocompletion .

### Secret Data

If you want keep your sensitive data untracked from git.
Create a `secrets.plugin.bash` and make a soft-link points to it. Such as `ln -s <your-path>/secrets.plugin.bash ./bash-custom/secrets.plugin.bash`.
All files under `bash-custom/enabled/` are untracked.
Then type `a enable-plugin secrets` and restart shell to enable it.

So, you could maintain your classified data in your `secrets.plugin.bash`.

### Bash Completions

Put your completion files under `completions/`.

Attention: this directory does not work for your sub-command completion.

### Create symbolic links

This feature benefits from [dotbot][].
Edit `install.conf.yaml`.
Run `./install` to create symbolic links.

**Do not call the script under sudo.**
